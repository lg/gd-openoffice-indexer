Licensed under LGPLv3 because of zlib. See the included LICENSE file.

Allow Google Desktop Search to index all OpenOffice.org and 
StarOffice 6 or later files, including text documents, 
spreadsheets, presentations and templates. Supported file types 
are SXC, STC, SXD, STD, SXI, STI, SXW, SXG, STW and STM. Newly 
added in version 1.01 is support for OpenDocument file types: ODT, 
OTT, ODG, OTG, ODP, OTP, ODS, OTS, and ODF. Plugin source code is 
available from trivex.net.

This plugin works by extracting the zip archive that OpenOffice
and StarOffice files are created as and indexing the content.xml
file as text.

To install, follow these instructions:
   1. Run the "LarrysOpenOfficeandStarOfficeIndexer.exe" file in 
      the zip.
   2. Agree to the registration with Google Desktop Search.
   3. You're done! Your system will now be indexing OpenOffice and
      StarOffice files.

To uninstall, follow these instructions:

   1. Go to your Start menu and select "Control Panel".
   2. Select "Add/Remove Programs"
   3. Find "Larry's OpenOffice and StarOffice Indexer" and click 
      "Remove".
   4. Thats it!
